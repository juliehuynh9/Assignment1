# Assignment1

In this assignment, I made a tokenizer that will grab tokens that are alphanumeric and are in English.
It will grab the tokens, compute the number of occurences of that token in a text file and print it out.
In PartB, we are able to look at 2 text files and compare how many common words those 2 text files have.
