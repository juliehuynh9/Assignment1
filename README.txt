Part A:

In this assignment, I made a tokenizer that reads a file byte by byte. It grabs tokens that are alphanumeric and in English.
It computes the number of occurences the token shows up and prints it out.

Part B:
We can compare 2 text files and see the number of common tokens between the two text files and print out the common words.
